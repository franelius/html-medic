<h1>Few words about me...</h1>
<p>I live in Croatia and I decided as a teenager that I will become financially independent<br/>
    and create my own above average life. As a professional mountain bike athlete, I am dedicated to my goals and <br/>
    ready to devote all my energy to them. Web development is something that I find very interesting because<br/>
    of its way to express your creativity and create content in this super fast growing
    wonderworld we all call Internet.
</p>
<p>
    By taking the Udemy online course to become a senior web developer, i am looking forward to<br/>
    work on my web development skills and knowledge, with the aim of being able to create high<br/>
    quality websites for other people, businesses, etc.
